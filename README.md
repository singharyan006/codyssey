# ByteWriter

ByteWriter is a powerful and user-friendly text editor designed for efficient coding and writing, serving as a core CS learning project to master fundamental concepts before scaling up.

## Project Overview

ByteWriter starts as a simple yet functional text editor allowing users to create, open, edit, and save plain text files with essential features. It follows a gradual development approach focused on learning core computer science principles like data structures, file handling, and UI design before adding advanced functionality.

## Learning Goals

- Implement efficient data structures for text manipulation
- Master file I/O operations and persistence
- Gain experience with event-driven programming and user interface design
- Build modular, maintainable, and scalable code
- Explore algorithms for text editing such as search, replace, and undo/redo

## Planned Features

- Basic text editing: insert, delete, copy-paste
- File operations: open, save, save as
- Multi-level undo and redo functionality
- Syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Real-time collaboration and cloud syncing (future scope)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow setup instructions for your chosen technology stack
3. Begin by implementing the core editor modules
4. Gradually add advanced features as you master the basics

## Contribution

This project is mainly for personal learning, but contributions and suggestions are welcome.
