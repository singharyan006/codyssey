# CODYSSEY

Codyssey is an AI-enhanced web platform that guides students and developers on their journey to writing cleaner, more maintainable Java code. Unlike traditional online compilers or heavy enterprise tools like SonarQube, Codyssey is built with a learning-first approach, making it ideal for academic use in courses such as Advanced Programming Practice (APP) as well as for self-learners.

At its core, Codyssey enables users to paste or upload Java code, which is then analyzed through a blend of static analysis and AI-driven mentoring. The static analysis module (leveraging tools like PMD and Checkstyle) detects common issues such as inconsistent naming, unused variables, overly complex methods, and violations of object-oriented principles. Based on these findings, the system generates a Code Quality Index (0â€“100), providing a clear, quantifiable measure of code health.

What sets Codyssey apart is its AI Mentor layer, which not only highlights issues but also delivers actionable improvement suggestions in simple, student-friendly language. For example, it may recommend breaking large methods into smaller ones, renaming variables for clarity, or reducing duplicate code through inheritance and interfaces. This ensures that users not only identify weaknesses but also learn how to improve their coding practices.

With an intuitive web interface, built-in code editor, detailed feedback display, and progress tracking, Codyssey transforms code review into an engaging learning experience. Faculty dashboards can also track class-wide performance, making it a valuable tool for both teaching and skill development.
